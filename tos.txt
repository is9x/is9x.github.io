Terms of Service (ToS) — Banana Add-on 🍌
Last updated: May 2025

Welcome to Banana — the freshest Slides Add-on to juice up your presentations. By using Banana, you agree to these terms. If you don’t, well, no banana for you.

1. Use at Your Own Risk
Banana is provided as-is and as-available. We ain’t responsible if your slides go bananas, crash, or cause your computer to explode (probably won’t, but hey, disclaimers).

2. Privacy & Data
We don’t collect or sell your personal data. Banana only accesses what it needs to run in Slides. No sneaky stuff, promise.

3. Intellectual Property
Banana and all its content belong to us — unless otherwise noted. You can use it, but don’t steal or sell it as your own. Sharing is caring, but plagiarism is whack.

4. No Warranty
No guarantees this thing won’t break or mess up your work. Use backups, be smart.

5. Changes to Terms
We might update these ToS whenever. Continued use means you accept new terms. Keep your eyes peeled (Get it!?.).
