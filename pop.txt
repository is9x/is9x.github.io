Privacy Policy — Banana Add-on 🍌
Last updated: May 2025

Banana is all about making your Slides look sick without messing with your data. Here’s how we roll:

1. What Data We Collect
Nada. We don’t collect, store, or share any personal information. Banana only uses what it needs to run inside Google Slides (like basic app permissions), and that’s it.

2. How We Use Data
The add-on operates within Google Slides and Google’s ecosystem. It does not send your data anywhere else or use it for ads or tracking.

3. Cookies & Tracking
We don’t use cookies, trackers, or any creepy surveillance tech.

4. Third-Party Services
Banana loads some stuff from external URLs (like Three.js from CDN), but those services have their own privacy policies. We don’t control their data collection.

5. Security
We keep your experience tight but can’t guarantee 100% security (nobody can). Use at your own discretion, but we work to keep everything safe and clean.

6. Changes to Privacy Policy
We might update this policy if we add new features or change stuff. Check back here occasionally.

Keep it breezy, keep it safe, and let Banana make your Slides fire. 🍌✨
